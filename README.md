# ToDo App

This is my first full sveltekit app with user authentication and authorization also with sign up with google option. User can create his todo list by adding, updating and deleting the items. App provides markdown support for list items. You can test the app [here](https://main--dancing-praline-321ecd.netlify.app) (this is quick netlify free tier demo so dont mind the link)

## Disclaimer
The app isnt fully responsive on mobiles and have some bugs. So please test it on desktop for best user experience.
